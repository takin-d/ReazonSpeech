============

This repository provides access to the main user tooling of ReazonSpeech and AVista projects.

**ReazonSpeech**

* Building the world‚Äôs largest open Japanese speech corpus.
* Project page: https://research.reazon.jp/projects/ReazonSpeech/

**AVista üê¶‚Äçüî• -- Toward a new vista of Human‚ÄìRobot Interaction**

* Project for noise‚Äërobust multimodal speech recognition for human‚Äìrobot interaction and beyond.
* "AVista" stands for **A**\udio‚Äë**VI**\sual **S**\peech **T**\ranscription & **A**\lignment, and the name contains the Latin words "avis", meaning bird, and "vista", meaning view or sight.
